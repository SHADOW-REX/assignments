        Animation is a method by which still figures are manipulated to appear as moving images. In traditional
        animation, images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited
        on film. Today, most animations are made with computer-generated imagery (CGI). Computer animation can be very
        detailed 3D animation, while 2D computer animation (which may have the look of traditional animation) can be
        used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth, or faster real-time renderings. Other common animation methods apply
        a stop motion technique to two- and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts, puppets, or clay figures.

        A cartoon is an animated film, usually a short film, featuring an exaggerated visual style. The style takes
        inspiration from comic strips, often featuring anthropomorphic animals, superheroes, or the adventures of human
        protagonists. Especially with animals that form a natural predator/prey relationship (e.g. cats and mice,
        coyotes and birds), the action often centers on violent pratfalls such as falls, collisions, and explosions that
        would be lethal in real life.</a>.
